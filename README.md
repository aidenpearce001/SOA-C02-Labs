SOA-C02 is the first AWS exam that includes 2 sections
- Objective questions
- Hands-on labs

SOA-C02 Exam is for 190 minutes with 51 objective-type questions and 3 Hands-on labs.

Labs are performed in a separate instance with 135 minutes

Labs are pretty easy if you have worked on AWS.

NOTE: *Once you complete a section and click next you cannot go back to the section. The same is for the labs. Once a lab is completed, you cannot return back to the lab.*

I create this repo as a References for anyone that never worked with AWS or have very little experience on it's
